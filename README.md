# Terraform course labs demo

The labs for this course can be worked on in a number of different ways:

### 1) Local installation of Terraform on your device

Please follow the instructions from https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install for your operating system.

### 2) Using your cloud provider's web shell option

All major cloud provider have Terraform preinstalled in their web shell environments. Note that if you create .tf files, they might not persist automatically. The same is true for local .tfstate files.

### 3) Use killercoda.com

Killercoda.com has a free instance available for one hour. You can just use the basic Ubuntu playground available at https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu . Note that you will have to install Terraform the same way as you would locally here and that your work is not persisted.

### 4) Training course environment

If you're taking our official course, you will get access to a shell environment. It can either be connected to via SSH or over the browser. The hostname, as well as username and password, will be sent to you by your instructor.

## Configuring Terraform access to your provider

Instructions on how to authenticate to different cloud providers are shared during the lab sessions.
